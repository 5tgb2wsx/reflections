Using diff -u showed all the changes between the two files.
I then just needed to look for a typo on the lines that changed.
This was easier than scanning the whole file.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient 
programmer in the long term?
1. If bugs are introduced you revert back to the previous version.
2. You can find introduced bugs easier by showing changes.


How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
1. git log shows you a sequential log of changes with author and date/time stamps.
2. git diff shows you the differences between two commits.
